#not as simplified as one would

tippecanoe -o Refined_2.mbtiles -K 30 --drop-fraction-as-needed -zg newRoute.json
#unwanted behavior at large zoom, does not delete artifacts

tippecanoe -o Refined_3.mbtiles -rg --drop-fraction-as-needed -zg newRoute.json 
#delete too much data, my guess it that it drops linestring instead of simplifying them

tippecanoe -o Refined_6.mbtiles -S 10 --drop-densest-as-needed -zg newRoute.json 
#line simplification -better but would like more simplification at low zoom and less simplification at high zoom, reduces a bit file size

tippecanoe -o Refined_6.mbtiles -S 10 --drop-densest-as-needed -zg newRoute.json 
#same as above but less simplification

tippecanoe -o Refined_8.mbtiles -S 5 --drop-densest-as-needed --minimum-zoom=5 --maximum-zoom=15 newRoute.json
#fixed the issue with higher maximum-zoom (was 12 before)

tippecanoe -o Refined_10.mbtiles --feature-filter-file=filter_wander.json -S 15 --drop-densest-as-needed --minimum-zoom=5 --maximum-zoom=16 newRoute.json
#add a filter file, does not drop data anymore yepee -> rename to wander_weg
